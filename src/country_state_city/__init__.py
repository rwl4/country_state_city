Country State City Library

A Python library that provides access to country, state, and city data.

The library provides classes for working with geographical entities:
- Country: Access country data including ISO codes, flags, and timezones
- State: Access state/province data linked to countries
- City: Access city data linked to states and countries
- Timezone: Access timezone information for countries

Example:
    from country_state_city import Country, State, City

    # Get all countries
    countries = Country.get_countries()

    # Get a specific country
    us = Country.get_country_by_code('US')
    print(f"Country: {us.name}, Flag: {us.flag}")

    # Get states of a country
    california = State.get_state_by_code('US', 'CA')

    # Get cities in a state
    cities = City.get_cities_of_state('US', 'CA')
